This repo will host some jupyter notebook as my efforts of learning some cosmology. The attempts will be based on Peebles' Principles of Physical Cosmology (hereafter PoPC).

PoPC is fantastic book to read, however I am not a theoretician. In order to understand cosmology in its entirety, I have to work out problems, or better do some simulations. So, my plan is to gather the required data and do some of the simple calculations and simulations given in PoPC. 

The notebooks given here are not foolproof, so you have been warned !
